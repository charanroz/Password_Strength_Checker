# Password Strength Checker

This is a C program that checks the strength of a password. It evaluates whether the password is **Very Strong**, **strong**, **moderate**, or **weak** based on certain criteria.

## Features
- Analyzes password length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
- Categorizes the password as **Very Strong**, **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak** based on these criteria.
- Helps users choose stronger passwords for better security.

## How it Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a password.
2. It checks the password against a set of rules:
   - Length of the password
   - Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Inclusion of numbers and symbols
3. Based on these checks, it outputs the strength of the password: **Very Strong**, **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak**.
